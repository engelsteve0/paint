P A I N T Version 0.0.8 -  09/30/2022
New features:
  * Added undo and redo (using two stacks for each tab), with buttons and keyboard shortcuts
  * Added ability to select, copy, cut, and paste parts of an image, with keyboard shortcuts
  * Added ability to directly move a selected part of an image

  * Added a polygon tool, can draw any number of sides (with user input)
  * Added a night mode option, with a toggle button under the view menu
Known issues:
  * Adding tabs and then doing a certain sequences of undos and redos can cause undos to take two "undo" operations to actually register. This is not program-breaking, but is mildly annoying.
  * Undo, redo, copying/cutting/pasting, etc. can cause smaller images to become slightly blurred on smaller monitors
Expected next sprint:
  * Adding autosave ability

P A I N T Version 0.0.4 -  09/26/2022
New features:
  * Added color grabber tool
  * Added square/rect and circle/ellipse tools. To get a perfect square/perfect circle, hold shift while drawing. Otherwise, draws a rect/ellipse
  * Added dashed line tool, scales with width/size
  * Added tabs, each of which has a canvas/file associated with it. Name updates based on what canvas is saved as.
  * Added smart/aware save warning, both for closing the whole program, and individual tabs
  * Added a Save All option to the file menu
  * Added a Resize Canvas option to the file menu- resizes canvas area to user-specified pixel width/height. Image scales correctly but may blur slightly
  * Added ability to save as a bmp, fixed previous bug where jpgs were actually saving as pngs. Can now save in 3 file formats (png, jpg, bmp)
Known issues:
  * Color grabber will usually get the same color as was used to create a feature, but if the line width is too small, it may be a "blur" of that color
Expected next sprint:
  * Adding undo, redo, clear canvas options, more tools, selecting parts of image

P A I N T Version 0.0.2 -  09/16/2022
New features:
  * Added exit option to file menu, as well as separators dividing sections
  * Added Help menu, with help and about options. These open popups which give the user information
  * Added toolbar, with selectable pencil, eraser, straight line tools, as well as width/size and color pickers
  * Pencil tool allows user to draw freely
  * Eraser tool functions like pencil tool but always draws white (a "blank" canvas)
  * Line tool allows user to preview a straight line visually. When the mouse is released, the line is actually added to the canvas.
  * Width/size picker includes a slider and text area, allowing the user to choose any value between 1 and 50
  * Size and color pickers affect the width/size and color of the pencil/line being drawn (does not affect eraser tool)
  * Gave user ability to pan around canvas by grabbing and dragging with left mouse when no tools are selected
Known issues:
  * Rare bug: line drawing on a newly opened large canvas can occassionally cause the line to veer off in an unexpected direction
  * This is quite rare and is easily corrected by the user, but is slightly annoying.
Expected next sprint:
  * Fixing bug listed above
  * Adding more tools: fill, paintbrush for example.

P A I N T Version 0.0.1 -  09/09/2022
New features:
  * The application itself, with a custom icon and title that displays the file currently being worked on
  * Borderpane-based GUI: menu bar with menus for file, view, canvas for displaying image, scrollbars
  * Opening various types of image files with file picker (PNG, JPG, etc.) 
  * Saving (prompting user to save as for new files)
  * Save as (allowing user to choose how (name/extension) and where (directory) files are written)
  * Ability to toggle fullscreen mode under view menu
  * Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (CTRL S for save, CTRL O for open, CTRL N for new, F11 for fullscreen, etc.)
  * Ability to scale/scroll through large files
Known issues:
  * JPG files will save with the JPG extension, however they are still actually saving with the PNG "saving method".
       The "JPG" saving method occassionally fails to save files at all while displaying nothing to the user to indicate this.
       For now, the PNG saving method is being utilized instead for all image files, but this will ideally be changed in a future release.
	 To clarify, JPG files can presently be saved, but there is a superior method for doing so that should eventually be added
Expected next sprint:
  * Fixing JPG issue listed above
  * Better zoom/pan/scroll controls- generally good so far but can become clunky near edges of files  
  * Being able to actually paint on (edit) the image
